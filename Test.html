      All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why you too should learn it.
    </p>

    <h4>What is HTML?</h4>

    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yperText <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web
      developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
      programming language).
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      In HTML, each element is made up os 3 parts: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The opening Tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>        
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>
   

    <p>
      You can learn more at the 
      <a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube</a> website and
      <a href="https://fiver.com" target="_blank">Fiver</a>
    </p>

     <h4>Why should you learn HTML?</h4>

    <p>
      There are countless reasons for 
      learning fundamental language of the web. 
      Here are 5 of them:
    </p>

      <ul>
        <li>To be able to use fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools 
          like wordpress or wix</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      Hopefully you learned something new here. 
      See you next time!
    </p>

    That was the first time we saw it. I can remember what happened at the 
    time and it was a rush of events and someone misunderstood me
